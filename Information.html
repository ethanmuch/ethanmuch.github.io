		<td class = "td11">Born to Karen and Andrew Much on April 18, 2000 in Atlanta. After going to Temple Sinai pre-school, I attended Galloway from pre-k to 7th grade. I then moved to Pace Academy for 8th grade. Since a young age, I have played soccer and basketball. Throughout my childhood, my family has taken numerous trips, including Iceland, Argentina, Amsterdam, Spain, and more. I have 2 sisters, Hannah (2006) and Rachel (1997). Hannah is a current 5th grader at Galloway, who will go to school at Pace next year (2017-2018) for 6th grade. Rachel is 19 years old, a Pace graduate, and a current sophomore at the University of Chicago. At Pace, I participate in activities, including PASEC, PASS, Admissions, and more. As a member of the class of 2018, I will be graduating from Pace next year. This year, my courses include AP Latin, AP Literature, AP US History, Honors Biology, and Honors Pre-Calculus. My electives this year are Robotics 1 (first semester) and Introduction to Programming. I am very interested in movies and TV, and my favorite shows include House of Cards, Silicon Valley, 30 Rock, Drunk History, and Impractical Jokers. I am a very outspoken fan of the Atlanta Hawks, Atlanta United FC, and the Atlanta Falcons. During the summer, I am a counselor at the Emory Eagles Boys Soccer Camp and an intern at Testgrid.io at the Atlanta Tech Village. </td>
