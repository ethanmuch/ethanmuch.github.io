		<td class = "td3">After years of planning, Mr. Hattori and Ms. Anderson have launched a new challenge for Pace upper school students involving social entrepreneurship. Mr. Hattori and Ms. Anderson are encouraging teams of students to develop business plans that provide innovative solutions to an issue that impacts the whole Pace community: transportation. Mr. Hattori defines social entrepreneurship as the future of philanthropy, taking sustainable business models and applying them to social issues. By using an entrepreneurial approach to solve social issues affecting the local community, students are encouraged  to think creatively. The challenge began on Sept. 11 and will extend through the school year, giving students time to fully develop their ideas. The business plans that students create are intended to become real ventures. A cash prize of $10,000 will be awarded  to the winning team so that they can start their business.

		Over the summer, Mr. Hattori contacted the office of the mayor to identify a focal point for the program. He wanted to keep the problem local and relatable to Pace students, so they chose something that everyone in the Pace community deals with on a day-to-day basis. Atlanta is known for being one of the worst cities in terms of its lack of public transportation, its environmental footprint, and especially its traffic. On Aug. 12, six upper school students met with Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx at Atlanta City Hall.  Although they didnâ€™t discuss the challenge at Pace specifically, students learned a lot about transportation and jobs in transportation from Mr. Foxx and Keith Parker, CEO of MARTA.

		At press time, Mr. Hattori estimated that five to ten teams of students will participate in the challenge. The Social Entrepreneurship Challenge is intended to be an annual competition, with the focus changing each year depending on the city needs. The mayor will be involved in helping to choose a new focus each year. Mentors from local businesses and the government will be helping to guide each team as they develop their plan.  The Social Entrepreneurship program seems like an awesome opportunity to really make an impact on the Atlanta community, said junior Sarah Lettes. -Grace Francour of the Knightly News 2013 </td>
